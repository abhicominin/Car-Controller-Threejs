# Car Controller with Three.js and Cannon.js
This is a car controller built with Three.js and Cannon.js that allows the user to simulate driving a car in a 3D environment. The controller allows the user to accelerate, brake, and steer the car, while the physics engine provided by Cannon.js simulates the car's movements and collisions realistically.

# Getting Started
To get started with the car controller, you'll need to have Three.js and Cannon.js installed on your computer. You can install these libraries using npm:
```
npm install
npm start
```


# Usage
To use the car controller, simply use the W,A,S,D,Spacebar on your keyboard to accelerate, brake, and steer the car. You can drive the car around a basic environment, such as a flat plane to adding terrain will be done in future 

# Future Improvements
In the future, we plan to add more advanced features to the car controller, such as:

- More complex and realistic environments with hills, bumps, and obstacles
- A realistic suspension system to simulate the car's movements more accurately
- Advanced driving techniques, such as drifting and powersliding
- Simulation of factors such as tire wear, fuel consumption, and engine damage
- Multiplayer support, allowing multiple users to race against each other in real-time
